## Expression: 

An expression is a combination of operators, constants and variables. An expression may consist of one or more operands, and zero or more operators to produce a value

**Example:**

```a+b```<br>
```c```<br>
```s-1/7*f```

### Constant expressions:

Constant Expressions consists of only constant values. A constant value is one that doesnâ€™t change.

**Examples:**

```5, 10 + 5 / 6.0, 'x'```

### Integral expressions:

Integral Expressions are those which produce integer results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.

**Examples:**

```x, x * y, x + int( 5.0)```

where x and y are integer variables.

### Floating expressions:

Float Expressions are which produce floating point results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions.

**Examples:**

```x + y, 10.75```

where x and y are floating point variables.

### Relational expressions:

Relational Expressions yield results of type bool which takes a value true or false. When arithmetic expressions are used on either side of a relational operator, they will be evaluated first and then the results compared. Relational expressions are also known as Boolean expressions.

**Examples:**

```x <= y, x + y > 2```

### Logical expressions: 

Logical Expressions combine two or more relational expressions and produces bool type results.

**Examples:**

```x > y && x == 10, x == 10 || y == 5 ```
