# INTRODUCTION
The word _**Python**_ -isn't it scary? Does it bring the image of big reptile that we prefer to see either in jungles or zoo? Well, it's time to change the image. Now on, you'll remember word _**Python**_ for its playfulness and pleasant productivity. Confused? Well, Don't be - because, now on you'll get introduced to a new programming language namely "**Python**", which promises to make you a big programming fan :-).

Python programming language was developed by **Guido Van Rossum.**

Python is a easy-to-learn yet powerful object oriented programming language. It is a very high level programming language yet as powerful as many other middle-level not so high-level languages like _C, C++, Java etc_.

>Do you know Python, the programming language, was named after famous BBC comedy show namely **_Monty Python's Flying Circus_**

 ### Pluses of Python
* Easy to Use Object Oriented Language
* Expressive Language
* Interpreted Language
* Its Completeness
* Cross-platform Language>* Free and Open Source
* Variety of Usage / Application

Before you start working with Python, you need to install Python on your computers. There are multiple Python distributions available today.

>Default installation available from [install python](www.python.org) is called **CPython installation** and comes with _Python interpreter, Python IDLE(Python GUI)_ and _Pip(pakage installer)_

Once you have Python installed on your computers, you are ready to work on it. You can work in Python in following different ways: 
* in Interactive mode _(also called Immediate Mode)_
* in Script mode
### Working in Interactive Mode(Python IDLE)
Interactive mode of working means you type the command - one command at a time, and the Python executes the given command there and then gives you output. In interactive mode, you type the command in front of Python command prompt >>>. _For example,_ if you type **2+5** in front of Python prompt, it will give you result as 7

>Interactive mode proves very useful for testing code; you type the commands one by one and get the result or error one by one.
### Working in Script Mode(Python IDLE)
What if you want to save all the commands in the form of program file and want to see all output lines together rather than sandwiched between successive commands? With interactive mode, you cannot do so, for:
* Interactive mode does not save the commands entered by you in the form of a program.
* The output is sandwiched between the command lines.

The solution to above problems is the **Script mode**. In the Script mode, you can store all commands together in the form of a module / program / script and can get all output lines together (No more command-output sandwiching :)
# Variables 
Variables represent labelled storage locations, whose values can be manipukated during program run.
In Python, to create a variable, just assign to its name the value of appropriate type. For example, to create a variable namely **Student** to hold student's name and variable **age** to hold student's age, you just need to write somewhat similar to what is shown below: 
>Student = 'Jacob'

>Age = 16
