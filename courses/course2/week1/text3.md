# Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python supports the following operators namely: _Arithmetic operators, Assignment operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators, Identity operators, Membership operators, Bitwise operators._
### Arithmetic operators 
>Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| +   | Addition      | x + y   |
|-  | Subtraction        | x - y     |
| *      | Multiplication       | x * y   |
| /| Division       | 	x / y      |
| %    |Modulus      | x % y  |
| **   | Exponentiation        |x ** y     |
| //     | Floor division       | x // y   |
### Assignment operators
>Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| =   | Assignment      | x = y   |
| +=  | Addition assignment        | x += y     |
| -=      | Subtraction assignment       | x -= y   |
| *=| Multiplication assignment       | 	x *= y      |
| /=    |Division assignment      | x /= y  |
| %=   | Modulus assignment       |x %= y     |
| **=     | Exponentiation assignment      | x **= y   |
| //=     | Floor division assignment       | x //= y   |
### Comparison operators
>Comparison operators are used to compare two values

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| ==     | Equal to       | x == y   |
| !=     | Not equal to       | x != y   |
| >     | Greater than       | x > y   |
| <     | Less than       | x < y   |
| >=     | Greater than or equal to       | x >= y   |
| <=     | Less than or equal to       | x <= y   |
### Logical operators
>ogical operators are used to combine conditional statements

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| and     | Logical AND       | x and y   |
| or     | Logical OR       | x or y   |
| not     | Logical NOT       | not x   |
### Identity operators
>Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| is     | Identity       | x is y   |
| is not     | Not identity       | x is not y   |
### Membership operators
>Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object


| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| in     | Membership       | x in y   |
| not in     | Not membership       | x not in y   |
### Bitwise operators
>Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers

| Operator      | Name | Example     |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| &     | Bitwise AND       | x & y   |
| \|     | Bitwise OR       | x \| y   |
| ^     | Bitwise XOR       | x ^ y   |
| ~     | Bitwise NOT       | ~x   |
| <<     | Left shift       | x << y   |
| >>     | Right shift       | x >> y   |
# Expressions
An expression in Python is any valid combination of _operators, literals and variables._ The expressions in Python can be of any type: _arithmetic expressions, String expressions, relational expressions, logical expressions, compound expressions, etc._
**An Expression in Python is any valid combinaiton of opertors and atoms. An expression is composed of one or more operations.**
>Relational Operations: x>y, y<=z, z!=x, z==q, x<y>z, x==y!=z

>Logical Operations: a or b, b and c, a and not b, not c or not b

>String Operations: "and" + "then" (_concatenation_), "and" * 2 (_replication_)
